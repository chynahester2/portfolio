<p> Robotics Day 1:
Both Manuela and Ayanna works incorporate robots. ALso they create robots to benefit humans.
For example,Ayanna creates robots that have helped scientists understand planets and the structure.
Manuela's robots have allwoed humasn to have a machine to answer questions and function. My team 
worked great on figuring everything out. But Mnaya and I could have helped Andrea more instead of letting her takeover as much</p>
<p> Robotics Day 2: Today I learned with circuits that one part is positive on the lighbulb and the other side is negative
and that will effect which port to plug the lightbulb in. My favorite part of today was getting the robot to cha cha by 
moving back and forth. The output that Mnauela & Ayanna would need are to allow the robot to sense when it hits a object 
and know to turn around. Also the robot will need to predict when hitting an object 
what did i lrarn circuits 2 fav part of today3 what kind of output does manuela and ayanna have
